<h1>Expander</h1>
-------------------------

This module is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal contributed module 'jQuery Expander'. 

The Expander Plugin is a simple little jQuery plugin to hide/collapse a portion 
of an element's text and add a "read more" link so that the text can be viewed 
by the user if he or she wishes. By default, the expanded text is followed by a 
"re-collapse" link.


<h2>Status</h2>

This port requires thorough testing.

<h2>Installation</h2>

This module makes use of the libraries module which should also be installed.

Install this module as usual, then add the required javascript library to location /libraries
